Wheel of Islam — Tone of Voice & Copywriting Guide

🎯 Goal
This guide helps everyone involved in writing, designing and training content for Wheel of
Islam — so everything is correct in terms of tone, target audience and accessibility. We're not building a learning platform,
but a safe space. The language must reflect that.

✅ Do's — What works?
Aspect Guideline
Language Level Use simple, human language: "Finding peace", "Calming your heart"
Addressing emotion Name feelings: doubt, pressure, longing, loss, support
Tone Warm, inviting, not lecturing: "You don't have to do it alone"
Growth focus "Your path, your pace, with Islam as guide"
Usage situations Think small and recognizable: "Before sleep. During stress. On the train."
Gentleness Words like: calm, reflect, come home, reconnect
Accessibility Copy must work for non-practicing or searching Muslims
Inclusion Normalize doubt, return, restart: "You can start over."
Example sentences: - "Your doubts. Your faith. Your pace." - "Islam, but understandable, visual and personal." - "For your head and your heart." - "You don't need to know everything to start."

❌ Don'ts — What to avoid?
Aspect What not to do
Jargon No words like 'aqidah', 'usul', 'madhhab' in marketing copy
Putting pressure No texts like: "Become a better Muslim", "Learn everything about Islam"
Normative language Don't judge: "Good Muslims do...", "You must..."
Complex explanation structures No book-like structure or fatwa structure in intro content
Authoritative tone No external quotes like "According to scholars..." in the marketing flow
Exclusion No language that suggests it's "only for the pious"
Harshness No religious threats or fear language — app = inner guidance

🧠 Core principle:
"If a young adult with doubt or stress doesn't dare to open up to an
imam, they should dare to open up to our app."
That's how we test all our content, AI output, onboarding flows and communication.

📄 Applications
AI Training Prompts: Use this style and tone in GPT training
Onboarding Texts: Formulate each goal softly and recognizably
Website / App Store: Focus on 'peace, direction, faith — without judgment'
In-app Modules: Explain Islamic concepts, but always with empathy, peace and personal
relevance

🌙 Final sentence for brand feeling
Wheel of Islam doesn't speak from the pulpit, but next to you on the couch. It helps you
remember what your heart already knew — without having to be ashamed that you lost it for a while.
