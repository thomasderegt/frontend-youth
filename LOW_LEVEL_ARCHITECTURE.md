LOW LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
A Modular Monolith is a single Django application containing multiple self-contained modules, where each module encapsulates related functionality behind a clean public interface while keeping all internal implementation details private.

Architecture Principles
Package by Module/component
Each module groups related functionality together. For example, the RAG module handles all Islamic Q&A and knowledge retrieval, while the Chatbot module manages all conversation and bot interaction logic. 
This creates clear boundaries where developers know exactly which module to use for specific functionality.

One Public Interface per Module
Each module exposes only one public class that serves as the entry point for all functionality within that module. 
This follows the principle of "one place to go" - if you need RAG functionality, you use the RAG module's public interface. 
If you need chatbot functionality, you use the Chatbot module's public interface.

Private Implementation
All internal classes, models, services, and repositories are marked as private using Python's underscore convention. 
This means the internal structure of each module is completely hidden from other modules. 
Only the public interface is accessible, ensuring that implementation details can change without affecting other parts of the system.

Compiler-Enforced Boundaries
The Python interpreter enforces module boundaries through the underscore naming convention, preventing accidental access to private implementation details. 
This provides architectural enforcement at the language level rather than relying on developer discipline.

Module Structure
Each module follows a consistent structure where the public interface is clearly separated from private implementation. 
he module directory contains a public interface file that exposes the module's functionality, while all other files are marked as private with underscore prefixes. 
This creates a clear separation between what the module offers to the outside world and how it implements that functionality internally.

Module Communication
Module communicate through their public interfaces rather than accessing each other's internal implementation details. 
When one module needs functionality from another module, it imports and uses the public interface of that module. 
This creates a clean dependency graph where modules depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
  
Clear Boundaries
Each module has a well-defined public interface that clearly communicates what functionality it provides. 
Internal implementation details are completely hidden, making the system easier to understand and maintain.

Independent Development
Teams can work on different modules simultaneously without interfering with each other. 
Changes to internal implementation don't affect other modules as long as the public interface remains stable.

Easy Testing
Modules can be tested in isolation by mocking their dependencies through public interfaces. 
This makes testing more focused and reliable, as each test only needs to concern itself with the module being tested.

Future Migration
The clean interfaces and clear boundaries make it straightforward to extract modules into separate microservices later. 
The public interfaces serve as natural API boundaries for future service extraction.

Single Deployment
Unlike full microservices, the modular monolith maintains the simplicity of single deployment while providing many of the benefits of modular architecture. 
Shared resources like databases and authentication remain centralized.

Implementation Strategy
The implementation follows a phased approach starting with establishing module structure and public interfaces.
Then updating module communication to use these interfaces, followed by database modularity, and finally comprehensive testing and documentation.

Key Differences from Traditional Monolith
In a traditional monolith, all classes are typically public and accessible from anywhere in the codebase, leading to tight coupling and difficulty in maintaining clear boundaries. 
The modular monolith, by contrast, enforces strict encapsulation where only public interfaces are accessible, creating loose coupling and clear module boundaries.
This architecture provides the benefits of microservices such as modularity and clear boundaries while maintaining the simplicity of a monolith through single deployment and shared resources.
